# chronic-kidney-disease-exploration

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 15% of adults or approximately 37 million 
people in the United States. Most (9 in 10) adults with CKD do not know they 
have it. Half of the people with low kidney function who are not on dialysis do not 
know that they have CKD. (17) The data set we have procured has 25 features 
which may predict a patient with chronic kidney disease.
The purpose of this project is to utilize machine learning and statistical 
methodologies to analyze this data set and determine which features are the 
greatest factors in determining if a patient is likely to have a diagnosis of CKD.
Our findings are that some factors overwhelmingly dominate the predictive model 
in that they are the very definition of the disease, Other features in the model 
directly correlate to each other, and contribute to the overall probability that the 
patient has the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease.
